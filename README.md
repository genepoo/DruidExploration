# DruidExploration

Documentation of early experiments with Druid, a data store optimized for the storage of large time-series datasets.

## Why Druid?

## Installing Druid

Druid depends on [Apache ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) for distributed coordination, so install Zookeeper first:



### Install stand-alone
### (EASY) Install Imply Analytics Platform
  
## Ingesting data
### JSON specification of ingestion parameters corresponding to a csv or tsv dataset

## Querying ingested data
#### The terminology of Druid's data model
#### Types of queries: Timeseries, TopN and groupBy
#### Transforming data: Aggregations and postAggregations
#### Druid API queries
#### Plywood queries (used to be Facet.js)
#### Pydruid 
  
## Visualizing query results
### Aggregations and postAggregations in Superset
### Pivot, meet Plywood.
### Pydruid, the Gandalf of them all.
